
Welcome to Campus Eye 1.0 !

All you need to run CampusEye is a 1.6 (version 6) JDK
(not just the JRE, the full JDK).
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

You can load the demo data (strongly advised if you are new to
CampusEye) with the following command on the command line
from the CampusEye home folder (in Unix-like operating systems
type "./ant" rather than "ant"):

ant load-demo

Then start CampusEye:

ant start

(or "java -Xms128M -Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -jar infinite.jar")

Once CampusEye starts, you can look at the demo  at:
http://localhost:7080/partymgr

and the administration interface at:
https://localhost:7443/webtools

You can log in with the user "admin" and password "ofbiz".

To stop CampusEye:

ant stop

To get the list of available commands:

ant -p

You will also find several platform dependent scripts in the
"tools" folder (for example for Windows and Unix-like operating
systems, the startup scripts are startCampusEye.bat and startCampusEye.sh).

Note that the default configuration uses an embedded Java database
(Apache Derby) and embedded application server components such as
Tomcat, Geronimo (transaction manager), etc.

Enjoy!
